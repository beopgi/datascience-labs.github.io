<h4><span class="badge badge-info">Abstract</span></h4>
The illegal parking problem is the biggest problem around the world. Seoul and many metorpolitan cities are making great efforts to solve the problem by introducing policies to expand parking supply and curb parking demand. However, in urban areas of metropolitan cities, land prices are high and no site is available for parking lots, a vast budget is spent to make additional parking lots. Therefore, the creation of extra parking lots is extremely limited. Also, it is not easy to obtain parking lots because urban areas have a large floating population, an there is a variation in the floating population over time. In this paper, we present a method for selecting the optimal location for public parking lots through the Maximum Coverage Location Problem (MCLP). It allows policymakers to distribute parking demand in a metropolitan city and reduce parking concentration. Moreover, congestion on nearby roads can be alleviated by reducing queues for parking and wandering time to find a parking lot and reducing social costs to prevent illegal parking.
