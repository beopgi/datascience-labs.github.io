I joined the Department of Computer Engineering at [Dong-A University](https://english.donga.ac.kr/sites/english/index.do) in March 2018.  Since September 2021, I have been actively involved in the [Data Science Research Lab](https://www.datasciencelabs.org/), focusing on research related to site selection methodologies using data mining and graph networks.
